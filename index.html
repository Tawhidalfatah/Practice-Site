    <li> <h2 class="movie"> Shawshank Redemption</h2> </li>
    <p>It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.</p>

    <li><h2 class="movie">The Godfather</h2></li>
    <p>This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.</p>
    
    
    <img class="image" src="/Images/the-dark-knight.jpg" alt="Dark Knight">
    <li><h2 class="movie">The Dark Knight</h2></li>
    <p>Confidently directed, dark, brooding, and packed with impressive action sequences and a complex story, The Dark Knight includes a career-defining turn from Heath Ledger as well as other Oscar worthy performances, TDK remains not only the best Batman movie, but comic book movie ever created.</p>
    
    
    <img class="image" src="/Images/fight-club-1999.png" alt="Fight Club">
    <li><h2 class="movie">Fight Club</h2></li>
    <p>Everything about Fight Club is simply amazing. The acting, the directing, and the story is simply superb. However, going into this film I had already had had some of the major twists spoiled for me, and this is a movie that relies so heavily on those twists that knowing them will detract from the experience significantly. Because of that, the film is really only worth seeing of you have no prior knowledge of it whatsoever.</p>
    <img class="image" src="/Images/Parasite.jpg" alt="Parasite">
    <li><h2 class="movie">Parasite</h2></li>
    <p>This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece. It will make you belly laugh, it will chill you to the bone, and it will make you shed a tear. This movie will stay with you long after the credits are over.</p>
